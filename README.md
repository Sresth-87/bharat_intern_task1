Smart_Car_Parking_System_using_Arduino
This is My First Project Under Bharat Intern As A Intern In "Internet Of Things (IoT)"
in this project Component Used are as follows:
1.Arduino uno -1
2.LCD I2C display 16*2 -1
3. 5v Servo motor
4. IR sensor-2
5. Breadboard mini -1(for connection common ground and common vcc)
6. jumpers wire
According to this code when all the slots are filled ,after that other car is detected by the first or entry ir sensor then it gives the message that no slot is left,and the gate will not open for the car, the gate is made by using servo motor,but when the slot is left then it display how much slot is left and also the gate will open .here in my code total 4 slots are there .
Thats all Thankyou !!
